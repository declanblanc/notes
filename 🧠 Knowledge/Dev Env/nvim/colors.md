It became way more of a pain in the ass than expected to get my colorscheme correct - and it's still not exactly perfect. I installed a Monokai plugin that did most of the heavy lifting (syntax highlighting and whatnot) but the background was still the a dark blue color that I'm not fond of. I went ahead and ChatGPT'd my way through this issue and it turns out there are things called "Highlight groups" which seem to just indicate different parts of the vim GUI and allow you to change their colors. Unfortunately I struggled to find a decent source online that explains what each of these names refers to.
Despite this, I was still able to make some improvements just by playing around with things.

Maybe I'll try to change up the tmux color at some point but not a priority atm
