This is a repository for my note-taking. This repository will *not* be solely responsible for storing every last bit of note-taking that I do. It will instead focus on professional learning, not limited to computer science, but primarily computer science as that is my profession at the moment!

This system is inspired by the book *How to Take Smart Notes* by Sonke Ahrens and his interpretation of the Zettelkasten note-taking system. I previously attempted to implement this note-taking approach but found myself quickly overwhelmed with the possibilities it held. I was paralyzed by the complexity I could see over the horizon and instead of dealing with the complexity as it arrived, I tried to tackle it before I even began writing. This approach led me to quickly abandon the system as it felt impossible. I was making a futile effort to manage something that hadn't yet existed. 

This time around, my approach is to *just start*. Keeping things simple and letting the system evolve naturally. I would also like to avoid seeking too much outside influence on how to build this system (no YouTube videos to overcomplicate things). Even my reading of Sonke Ahrens was more skimming than I typically do. I will likely return to his writing but avoid too much beyond that.

Here is a rough outline of my plan: 

three types of notes = 3 folders? weird bc working mem will exist outside the system as well.

I will start with a folder that acts as a more haphazard note-taking space. Not quite a scratchpad, but a place to store ideas. For example if I am reading a book about AI Engineering and I find a section on self-supervised learning particularly interesting, I may take some time to cite what I am reading, and capture some of my own thoughts and understanding from what I am reading alongside this. This is NOT to be confused with quickly capturing ideas such as during a work meeting, during a lecture, or even while reading (if you don't want to interrupt your reading process).

	 "Fleeting notes are for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else ( . . . ) That might even apply to reading, if you want to to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins." (Smart Notes, c6p41)

A separate folder for organizing the ideas in a more meaningful way (go through the scratchpad, and elaborate)

~~This system, at a high-level, can be looked at as consisting of different types of notes. Ahrens categorizes types of notes slightly differently than I will here.~~ 
- ~~Fleeting Notes~~
	- ~~This category is just as Ahrens describes it. A place to quickly jot down an idea, which should be revisited not too long after to turn into a more permanent note.~~ 
- ~~Permanent Notes~~
	- ~~These notes~~ 

I've actually decided that rather than removing the previous section, I will use it as an opportunity to highlight the importance of writing and its applications for learning. 
Ahrens describes three different types of notes, Fleeting, Permanent, and Project. When I read this I thought, "I think I will categorize my notes a bit differently." Until just now when I began to write my thoughts I realized my thinking was not. I mention this here because it is a key point Ahrens makes that if we have yet to put something into our own words, we may think we understand it but until we write it down and capture it, it can be almost useless.
