I'm not sure where to begin with learning AI. 
I took a course called "Introduction to Data Science" at NJIT that scratched the surface of the mathematical side of building AI applications. More recently, I've started reading "AI Engineering" by Chip Huyen and while there's a ton of great information packed into this book, it's not quite the hands-on learning experience I was hoping for. 

Some other resources I've found:
[Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) - Interactive deep learning book with multi-framework code, math, and discussions. Adopted at 500 universities from 70 countries including Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and Cambridge.
