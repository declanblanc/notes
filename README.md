This is a repository for my note-taking.

This repository will *not* be solely responsible for storing every last bit of note-taking that I do. It will focus on professional learning, not limited to computer science, but primarily computer science as that is my profession at the moment!

This system is inspired by the book "*How to Take Smart Notes*" by Sonke Ahrens and his interpretation of the Zettelkasten note-taking system. I previously attempted to implement this note-taking approach but found myself quickly overwhelmed with the possibilities it held. I was paralyzed by the complexity I could see over the horizon and instead of dealing with the complexity as it arrived, I tried to tackle it before I even began writing. This approach led me to quickly abandon the system as it felt impossible. I was making a futile effort to manage something that hadn't yet existed. 

This time around, my approach is to *just start*. Keeping things simple and letting the system evolve naturally. I would also like to avoid seeking too much outside influence on how to build this system (no YouTube videos to overcomplicate things). Even my reading of Sonke Ahrens was more skimming than I typically do. I will likely return to his writing but avoid too much beyond that.

Here is a rough outline of my plan: 
### üìÅ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fleeting Notes 
This folder will act as a haphazard note-taking space. 
Notes in this folder are for quickly capturing ideas when I'm unable to write more meaningfully such as during a work meeting, a lecture, or while reading (if I don't want to interrupt my reading process).

> "Fleeting notes are for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else ( . . . ) That might even apply to reading, if you want to to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins." (Smart Notes, c6p41)

### üìÅ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Permanent Notes
This folder contains more thoughtful and intentional note-taking. 
To give an example, if I'm reading a book and find a section particularly interesting, I may take some time to write some of my own thoughts and ideas inspired by or derived from what I am reading alongside a citation of the material.
Calling this section "permanent notes" makes it feel somewhat intimidating. I want to avoid letting this big title prevent me from using this space to jot things down even if they may not feel significant enough.

### üìÅ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Notes
Ahrens describes this folder as a place for research papers but at this point I'm unsure what this folder will contain. 
I don't have writing projects right now, but perhaps I will begin to write more as a happy side-effect of this process. Alternatively, this space could contain broader topics, if `Permanent Notes` contains a dozen different documents about AI, `Project Notes` may contain more broad writing about AI, while the documents in `Permanent Notes` dive into more specific topics.
